# Swan - Jupiter Testnet Campaign

We are thrilled to announce the launch of **Swan - Jupiter Testnet**'s incentivized campaign! Running from November 20th, Be part of shaping Swan's future as an open marketplace for cloud resources.

Calling all Web3 developers, crypto enthusiasts, and service providers to explore Swan Testnet's key features and share feedback. A total of **150,000 SWAN** awaits contributors—let's drive innovation together!

### **Campaign Duration:**&#x20;

**November 20th, 2023, 00:00 (EST) - December 20th, 2023, 23:59 (EST)**

### Missions:

Swan Testnet aims to build an open and decentralized marketplace for cloud computing resources, powered by the Optimism Network. By incentivizing participation from computing providers worldwide, Swan seeks to expand access to GPU power for AI/ML projects and dApp deployment.

The testnet campaign provides an opportunity to demonstrate Swan's capabilities, gather feedback, and drive adoption by rewarding providers. This milestone represents a major step towards realizing the vision of an efficient, open marketplace for cloud computing.

### Goals:

* Onboard 50 new computing providers to the Swan testnet to expand geographic coverage and computing capacity
* Achieve over 100 GPUs contributed across computing providers to provide robust AI and dApp infrastructure
* Enable over $10,000 worth of computing transactions on the testnet for stability testing of multichain payment channels.
* Support the deployment of at least 500 Spaces on the Swan network
* Form strategic partnerships with 5 AI/ML projects to demonstrate Swan's ability to power cutting edge innovation
* Gather feedback from 30+ Computing Providers to help inform the roadmap and mainnet launch
* Distribute allocated SWAN rewards to incentivize providers and drive participation
* Document key learnings, challenges, and successes throughout the testnet launch to aid the transition to mainnet

### How to Participate

1\. Follow[ Documentation](https://docs.lagrangedao.org/lagrange-dao/computing) to deploy a Computing Provider.

2\. Check the [Dashboard](https://provider.lagrangedao.org/provider-status) to confirm if the Computing Provider is running, and maintain a provider uptime exceeding 90%.

3.Submission of the[ form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeTDXjTGmPB7MuSGJJZMO2Ctk12VAoYU6aTmLeFR0jeW5M-zw/viewform) is required upon task completion.

### Reward Structure

#### Reward 1: Universal Basic Income (UBI) Trial Rewards

Participants with successfully deployed and actively running Computing Providers will receive **600 SWAN (20 SWAN per day)** as part of the [UBI Trial Rewards program](https://docs.filswan.com/getting-started/protocol-stack/economic-system/universal-basic-income-ubi), designed to provide a basic level of compensation to qualified providers.

#### Reward 2: Contribution Rewards

Eligible Computing Providers contribute to the Swan Network and will receive a share of the prize pool of **100,000 SWAN** proportional to their contributions.&#x20;

Contributions are based on the amount of space deployed, GPU and CPU usage duration, and CP uptime.

#### Reward 3: Regional Computing Dao Pilot Program Rewards

Eligible new computing providers from countries without a representative CP will receive an additional **600 SWAN**.&#x20;

the U.S., Canada, the Netherlands, Ukraine, Finland, China, Japan, Singapore, Australia, and countries with existing computing providers are excluded from this Reward.

#### Reward 4: Referral Rewards

All eligible CPs who successfully refer new CPs to the Network, and the referred CP is also eligible, will receive a referral reward of **300 SWAN** tokens for each successful referral.

### Eligibility Criteria

* Run at least one **UBI task** during the campaign to confirm a successful setup.
* Maintain provider uptime exceeding **90%**.
* Submission of the [**form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeTDXjTGmPB7MuSGJJZMO2Ctk12VAoYU6aTmLeFR0jeW5M-zw/viewform) is required upon task completion.
